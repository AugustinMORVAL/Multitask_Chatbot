# Multitask Chatbot Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot that operates seamlessly on any computer setup. The project includes basic functionalities and additional features such as audio processing and file management.
## Features

### Core Functionalities

- **Text-based Interaction**: The chatbot can understand and respond to text-based queries effectively.
- **Context Awareness**: The chatbot maintains the context of the conversation to provide relevant responses.

### Additional Features

- **Audio Processing**:
  - **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text to enable voice-based interaction.
  - **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text responses into speech, providing a more natural and interactive user experience.
- **File Management**:
  - **File Upload/Download**: Users can upload and download files through the chatbot interface.
  - **File Processing**: The chatbot can read, understand, and manipulate the content of various file types (e.g., text, PDF).

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AugustinMORVAL/Chatbot_with_Groq.git
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Chatbot

```bash
  streamlit run app/feature_you_want_to_run.py
```


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

### Necessary API keys
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. This file will store your API keys and other environment variables.

| API keys     | Type     | Description                | Link to Create API Key |
| :------------| :------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `HF_TOKEN`   | `string` | **Required**. Your API key | [Create Hugging Face API Key](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | `string` | **Required**. Your API key | [Create Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com/keys) |


### (Additionnal) Loading Environment Variables in Your Python Code

Install the `python-dotenv` package:

```sh
pip install python-dotenv
```

Load the environment variables by using the `load_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package.

**Example of usage:**
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
HF_TOKEN = os.getenv("HF_TOKEN")
GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
```
## Future Enhancements
- **Proccessed files**: Enhancing the ability to handle a variety of file types.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Providing users with analytics and insights based on their interactions.
- **Web navigation**: Enabling the chatbot to browse and search web content.
- And more !
